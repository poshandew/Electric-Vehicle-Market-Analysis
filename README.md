## üìä Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**Total Vehicles**
Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.

**Average Electric Range**
-Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.

**Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles**
-Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.
-Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.

**Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles**
-Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset.
-Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.

## üìä Tableau Dashboard Use Case

-To bring this analysis to life, an interactive dashboard was created using Tableau. This dashboard enables stakeholders to:

-Filter data dynamically by year, vehicle type, or state for focused analysis

-Interact with visual elements to explore underlying patterns and relationships

-Gain real-time insights into electric vehicle trends, manufacturer dominance, and regional adoption

-Support decision-making for policymakers, automakers, and sustainability advocates by visualizing key metrics in a compelling format

The dashboard bridges the gap between data and insights, transforming raw numbers into strategic visual stories.
